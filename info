Create Polynomial Class 
 - 1 field: int array containing coefficients 
 - no args contstuctor: set arr = [0]
 - args contstructor: takes an array as an arg
 - add function: takes 2 polynomial objects as args, add 2 polynomials and return the new polynomial
 - evaluate function: takes an x-value as arg, evaluate y-value of polynomial at x-value
 - hasRoot function: takes an x-value as arg, check whether that x-value is a root of the polynomial
